Before define what a
<a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/sprint-zero/" class="external">Sprint
Zero really is</a>, letâ€™s see what it isnâ€™t.

- A Sprint Zero is not the phase in which the team is put together. In
  order to conduct a Sprint in the first place, a team must already be
  in place.
- A Sprint Zero is not the phase for setting up infrastructure which
  should already be implemented or easily implemented on demand, but not
  as part of a Sprint Zero.
- A Sprint Zero should not involve adding products to a backlog or
  Consider Planning as classical project with Gantt Diagrams plannings.

The main goal of a Sprint Zero is **to deliver some usable value that
can be built upon by the next team**. Sprint Zeros are required to:

- Create the projectâ€™s `skeleton`, including research spikes.
- `Keep design minimal`.
- Develop a small number of `stories` to completion.
- Be low velocity and lightweight.

More specifically, the deliverables of a Sprint Zero should be as
follows:

- A `usable` piece of code, however small.
- A `minimal` environment for writing code.
- A `prioritization` of features or a list of stories.
- A `release plan` assigning each story to a Sprint.
- A plan for the most likely implementation of `features`.

Letâ€™s take the example of the Library Lab (SE03) to define a graph with
the requirements for the Sprint Zero deriverables:

## Onion Architecture

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Onion Architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

The layers are of <a href="" class="external">Onion Architecture</a> and
sublayers are:

- `Infrastructure`, where our database, file system, or any external web
  service we depend on live.
- `Tests`: unit, integration, end-to-end. How we validate our business
  cases.
- `User Interface`, how our users interact with the code we have
  built. - Application Services layer (sometimes known as the
  Transport/Access Layer).
- `Domain Services` layer. In this layer is where the majority of our
  business logic lives, it carries out the operations to turn A into B,
  input into output, egg into chicken.
- The core layer, the `Domain Model` layer which is the representation
  of the high level data objects we use.
