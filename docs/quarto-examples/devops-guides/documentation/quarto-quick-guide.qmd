# Introduction

Here we'll describe some useful tips to reduce time and resources when creating Quarto projects

# Quarto workflow
## Render current file

```bash
quarto render ${quarto_file.qmd}
```

## Preview current `.qmd` file and enable live changes

```bash
quarto preview ${quarto_file.qmd} --no-browser --no-watch-inputs
```
Then, open the provided URL in a new browser tab/window

## Ensure that any `.qmd` file within the Quarto project is rendered on save
In `_quarto.yml` file, add the following lines:

```.yml
editor:
    render-on-save: true
```

## When publishing, don't render again the `.qmd` files (already rendered on save)

```bash
quarto publish gh-pages --no-render
```
