# Introduction

- [jHipster official website](https://www.jhipster.tech/)

# Getting started

- Make sure you have installed `Java`, `git` and [Node.js](../../react-exercises/00-getting-started.qmd)
- Install `jHipster`:
```{.bash}
$ npm install -g generator-jhipster
```

## Known bug with JHipster 7.9.3 and NodeJs > 16.0
JHIpster expects an additional `export` in its node module's `package.json` file --> [GitHub related bug](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/19627#issuecomment-1454327477)

```{.json filename="~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.12.1/lib/node_modules/generator-jhipster/node_modules/yeoman-environment/package.json"}
{ 
    "exports": {
        ...
        "./lib/util/namespace": "./lib/util/namespace.js"
    }
}
```

This bug is expected to be solved in `JHipster>=7.9.4`

:::

- Create a new directory and go into it:
```{.bash}
$ mkdir myApp && cd myApp
```

- Run JHipster and follow instructions on screen:
```{.bash}
$ jhipster
```

:::{.callout-tip}
## Avoid JHipster from locally commit after generation
By default, JHipster commits the project to your git project after creating it. If you just want a sandbox project and don't want these changes in your repository, launch it with the `--skip-git` option

```{.bash}
$ jhipster --skip-git
```
Other useful command-line options can be found [here](https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-app/#3)
