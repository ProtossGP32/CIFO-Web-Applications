# Introduction
Here you'll find tips to manage your GitLab repositories from the CLI

## GitLab Merge Requests
### Open a Merge Request
:::{.callout-important}
In order to open a MR, your local repository must have at least one commit pending to push to the remote branch
:::

Once all files are committed, launch the following command:

```{.bash filename="GitLab - Create MR"}
git push \
    -o merge_request.create \
    -o merge_request.target=<branch-where-to-merge-the-changes>
    <upstream-origin> <remote-branch>
```

These are the minimum required options to create the merge request, but you can add others to complete its information:

```{.bash filename="GitLab - Additional MR fields"}
# Set the merge request title
git push -o merge_request.title="<desired-title>"
# Set the merge request description
git push -o merge_request.description="Desired description"
# Set the merge request to remove the source branch once merged
git push -o merge_request.remove_source_branch
```
