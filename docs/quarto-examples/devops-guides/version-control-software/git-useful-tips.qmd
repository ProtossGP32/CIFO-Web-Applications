# Introduction
# Git commands
## Remote repository
### Get a copy of a remote repository
```bash
git clone <git-repository-url>
```

### Update list of repository's remote branches
```bash
git remote update origin --prune
```
- `--prune` removes any local reference to non-existing remote branches

## Branches
### Show available branches
```bash
git branch
```

- Also show remote branches:
```bash
git branch -a
```

### Clone an existing branch
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### Create a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

### Delete a local branch
```bash
git branch --delete <branch-name>
```

### Delete a remote branch
```bash
git push origin --delete feature/login
```

## Updating local checkouts
### Retrieve latest changes in remote repositories
```bash
git fetch
```
- This command downloads the git objects (blobs, trees and commits), it doesn't `merge` the changes into the local checkouts.
    - This means that the files in local branches are still behind the latest commits, they must be `merge`d or `fast-forward`ed

### Update local branches
```bash
git merge <remote-branch> <local-branch>
```

### Overwrite local branches with remote repositories
```bash
git pull
```
