# Introduction

# What does redux do?
A redux acts as a reducer, but instead of passing the payload and the operation to a reducer, it is sent to a `Store`, where it recreates the state of all Components. Redux lives outside the scope of the dispatcher, executes its `reducers` based on the received payload, and then acts over any component that has references to the redux.
