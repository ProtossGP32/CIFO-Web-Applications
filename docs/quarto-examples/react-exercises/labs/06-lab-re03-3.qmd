# Introduction

We'll pick up where we left off in the [Lab#RE03-1](./04-lab-re03-1.qmd). We'll create a To-Do list that retrieves data from a RESTful API (a mock-up API created with [mockAPI.io](https://mockapi.io)) and updates its entry.

# Getting started
Create a new ReactJS project with the following dependencies:

- `react-router-dom`
- `semantic-ui-react` and `semantic-ui-css`
- `axios`
- `uuidv4` for UUID generation. [LINK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4)
