# Introduction
[Link to class page](https://albertprofe.dev/reactjs/rjslab2.html)

Main objectives:

- We'll be uusing our own `RESTful API` in SpringBoot to create a React app that will display a list of publications
- We will use the Axios library to make HTTP requests to the API and retrieve the data in JSON format
- We will display the `publication data` in a table with fields that will depend on the publication type
- We will also add a `loading state` to show the user that the app is retrieving data from the API

The lab will demonstrate **how to use a RESTful API with React to build a functional web application**

# Create the app
Follow the same steps as in [the Lab-RE01-1](01-lab-re01-1.qmd) or simply clone the project into another directory.

Remember to install `axios` dependency inside the project.

# Prepare the Spring Boot API
We'll be using our Library Management Spring Boot API to retrieve any kind of resource, be it Publications, Users, Librarians, Authors, etc...

Leave it running while testing the React app.

# Modify the app
## BookList
Now the `BookList` component should request data from our SpringBoot API, so some things must be changed.

```{.js filename="BookList.jsx" include=../../../../react-exercises/lab-re02-1/src/BookList.jsx}
```

# Modify the Spring Boot API
Due to some restrictions related to [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), we must modify our `@RestController` mappings to accept incoming requests from the React app. In order to do so, we'll add the `@CrossOrigin` annotated followed by the `origins` parameter with the accepted URLs as values:

```{.java filename="PublicationsRestController.java" include=../../../../java-exercises/spring-boot-projects/spring-boot-lab-0/approach_1/src/main/java/com/springbootlab0/approach_1/rest_controllers/PublicationsRestController.java}
```

For now, we'll add `http://localhost:3000` as our React app URL, but when going to production, these paths should be parametrized.
