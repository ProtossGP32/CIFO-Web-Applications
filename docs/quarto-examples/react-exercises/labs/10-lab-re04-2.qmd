# Overall
## Define the use cases, user-stories and a mock-up of the desired features

## Frontend
We'll create a ReactJS client to retrieve the ToDo items and render them. It will include the business logic of managing the ToDo list (CRUD actions).

## REST API
Let's create a simple Spring Boot application that provides a REST controller for the Todo CRUD. We'll test it with Postman.

## noSQL
We'll use a mongoDB collection stored in our [cloud Atlas account](../../java-exercises/databases/00-mongodb.qmd) for simplicity.

:::{.callout-note}
# Further steps
Once this works, try to deploy your own mongoDB database and connect to it instead of the cloud.
