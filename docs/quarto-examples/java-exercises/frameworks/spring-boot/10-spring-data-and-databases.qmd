# Introduction
[_From Spring official page:_](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data#overview)

> Spring Dataâ€™s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.
>
>It makes it easy to use data access technologies, relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud-based data services. This is an umbrella project which contains many subprojects that are specific to a given database. The projects are developed by working together with many of the companies and developers that are behind these exciting technologies.

## Features:

- Powerful repository and custom object-mapping abstractions
- Dynamic query derivation from repository method names
- Implementation domain base classes providing basic properties
- Support for transparent auditing (created, last changed)
- Possibility to integrate custom repository code
- Easy Spring integration via JavaConfig and custom XML namespaces
- Advanced integration with Spring MVC controllers
- Experimental support for cross-store persistence

## Examples of database types

### SQL

- Normalized: typed database
- Very Structured: Less error-prone when dealing with its data as it is all very defined
- Low scalability: relational databases introduce high coupling between tables
- Relational database: tables linked by ID fields
- Example: each Java entity has its own table and they can be joined using ID fields

### NoSQL

- Not normalized: database isn't typed (JSON-style entries, documents)
- High scalability
- Fast query responses
- Examples:
    - DynamoDB
    - MongoDB
