# Introduction

# Rest API in Spring Boot

## `@RestController`
The Spring Boot annotation for the REST API controller. This annotation is responsible of converting the returned output to the expected plain-text format defined in the API documentation.

As with the `@Controller`, an endpoint is defined for this REST controller:

```{.java}
@RequestMapping("/path/to/api/endpoint")
```

Example:

```{.java}
@RequestMapping("/api/book")
```

## REST API services

Types of data that the REST methods will return:

- `ResponseEntity<T Entity>`: It's a container that includes the following data:
    - `HttpHeaders`: info regarding the API (i.e. version) as well as the operation confirmation
    - `Body` content: it stores the `Entity` or the collection of `Entity` that we want to return
