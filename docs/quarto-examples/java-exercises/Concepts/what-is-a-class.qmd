title: "What is a class?"

# Class definition
A *class* is a set of parameters and methods that define the abstraction of an object.
A *class* has the following elements:

* *Fields:* these are the parameters
* *Constructor:* method that creates a new class object. A constructor can accept input parameters to initialize
* *Methods:* functions that can use the *fields* values to compute required outputs or update its own fields

## Difference between class and object
* An *object* is an instance of a *class*
* Each *object* is independent of any other *object* of the same *class*
