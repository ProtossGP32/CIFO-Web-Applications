# Introduction
## What to take into account when creating objects:
- Where do we create them?
    - Project structure
    - Data types
    - Nested classes
- How do we create them?
    - `new`
    - `Factory` classes
- How do we manage them?
    - Methods creation
    - Manager classes
- How do we send data?
    - Send Object references to other classes

## Be aware of the scope of each Object!
Encapsulation is critical, keep variables within its required scope. Don't try to make them available to everyone if not critical.
