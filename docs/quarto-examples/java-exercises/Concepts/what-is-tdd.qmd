# Introduction

Test-driven Domain (TDD) is a software development process in which **tests are written for a piece of code before the code itself is written**.

* This approach is designed to ensure that the code meets the requirements and works as intended
* TDD involves the following steps:
    * Writing a test for a feature
    * Running the test to see if it fails
    * Writing the code to implement the feature
    * Running the test again to ensure that it passes
* TDD is often used in **agile software development** as it allows for the rapid development of **high-quality code**.
