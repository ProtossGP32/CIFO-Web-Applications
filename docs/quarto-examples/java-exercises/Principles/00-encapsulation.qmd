:::{.callout-note}
## Class notes definition
**Encapsulation** is the process of wrapping data and methods that operate on a data into a single unit. In other words, it is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world.

In Java, **encapsulation** is achieved through the use of access modifiers like `private`, `public` and `protected`.
