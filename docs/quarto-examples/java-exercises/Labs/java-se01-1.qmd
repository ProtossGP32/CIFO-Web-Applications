::: {.panel-tabset}
## Context
**Basic understanding of Java programming language is required**, as well as some familiarity with **Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies** and building the project.

**Knowledge of algotighms and data structures** to implement the required classes.

## Goal
**Create three classes in Java** (`Person`, `Account` and `Manager`) that implement different algorightms or data structures.

**Test these classes** using JUnit.

## Tasks
(@) Create **a new Maven or Gradle project** and setting up the project structure
(@) Modify the project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file to import necessary dependencies, including **JUnit** for testing
(@) Implement the three required classes in Java
(@) Implement two basic patter-designs: **singleton** and **think about factory**
(@) Write **JUnit tests** to verify that classes work as expected

## Optional
*   **Allow the user to input data via the console**, rather than using `hard-coded test data` in JUnit tests
