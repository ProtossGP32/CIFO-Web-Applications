# Maven Person

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Context
**Basic understanding of Java programming language is required**, as well as some familiarity with **Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies** and building the project.

**Knowledge of algotighms and data structures** to implement the required classes.

## Goal
**Create multiple classes in Java** (`Person`, `Student`, `Book`, `Car` and `Author`) using the most convenient entity relationship between them.

**Test these classes** using JUnit.

## Tasks
(@) Create **a new Maven or Gradle project** and setting up the project structure
(@) Modify the project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file to import necessary dependencies, including **JUnit** for testing
(@) Implement the required classes in Java
(@) Implement two basic patter-designs: **singleton** and **think about factory**
(@) Write **JUnit tests** to verify that classes work as expected

## Optional
*   **Allow the user to input data via the console**, rather than using `hard-coded test data` in JUnit tests

### Tests

:::{.callout-tip}
## Use the Code Coverage feature!
When launching tests, do it with Code Coverage to know how much of your code is being tested. Just click on the button next to the _Run_ one when executing a batch of tests or right-click on the _Play_ button next to each test:
