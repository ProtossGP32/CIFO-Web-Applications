title: "LAB#SE02-1: Movie/Review, model"
categories: [javase, lab]

# Introduction
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Context
**Basic understanding of Java programming language is required**, as well as some familiarity with **Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies** and building the project.

**Knowledge of algotighms and data structures** to implement the required classes.

## Goal
**Create three classes in Java** (`Movie`, `Critic` and `Review`) that implement different algorightms or data structures.

**Test these classes** using JUnit.

## Tasks
(@) Create **a new Maven or Gradle project** and setting up the project structure
(@) Modify the project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file to import necessary dependencies, including **JUnit** for testing
(@) Implement the three required classes in Java
(@) Implement two basic patter-designs: **singleton** and **think about factory**
(@) Write **JUnit tests** to verify that classes work as expected

## Optional
*   **Allow the user to input data via the console**, rather than using `hard-coded test data` in JUnit tests

## Dependencies

* Lombok (both dependency and Maven plugin):
```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok/lombok -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.24</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok/lombok-maven-plugin -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.20.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

```
* Junit:
```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
    <version>5.9.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

```
* Java Faker: dependency used to generate stub data for testing
```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.javafaker/javafaker -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.javafaker</groupId>
    <artifactId>javafaker</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>

```

## Domain design
### Movie
A `Movie` class shall represent a movie being reviewed. It should have the following attributes:

* `title`: a `String` representing the title of the movie
* `reviews`: a `Set` of `Review` objects representing the reviews that have been written for this movie
* `Critic`: The `Critic` class represents a critic who writes reviews

:::{.callout-tip}
## First iteration
In this first iteration, each `Movie` only has one `Critic`. Later on we can allow each `Movie` to be reviewed by multiple `Critic`s
:::

### Critic
A `Critic` class shall represent a critic and a `Review` of its own. It should have the following attributes:

* `name`: a String representing the name of the critic
* `Review`: the `Review` class represents a review of a movie written by a critic

:::{.callout-tip}
## First iteration
Again, in this first iteration each `Critic` has a single `Review`. This shall be fine-tuned.
:::

### Review
A `Review` class shall represent the information that identifies a review of a movie. It shall have the following attributes:

* `movie`: a `Movie` object representing the movie being reviewed
* `critic`: a `Critic` object representing the critic 

:::{.callout-tip}
## First iteration
Again, in this first iteration each `Review` has a single `Critic`. This shall be fine-tuned.
