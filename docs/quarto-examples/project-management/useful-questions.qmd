# Answering the useful (right?) questions
Questions that begin with the words **why, who, what and how** are necessary and paramount because they help to **clarify information, to seek additional details, and to better understand a situation**. Besides, they play a crucial role in **facilitating communication** and understanding.

These words are often used to ask **open-ended questions**, which are questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. Asking open-ended questions allows for more **in-depth conversation and debate** and can help to uncover important information or insights.

Overall, asking **why, who, what and how** can help to **imporve communication**, to **facilitate decision-making**, and to **deepen understanding**.
