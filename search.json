This approach increases the chances that you will choose the most satisfying alternative possible.\n\n\n\n\n7 Steps to Effective Decision Making"

    "text": "From spring.io:\n\nSpring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”.\n\n\n\n\nCreate stand-alone Spring applications\nEmbed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)\nProvide opinionated ‘starter’ dependencies to simplify your build configuration\nAutomatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible\nProvide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration\nAbsolutely no code generation and no requirements for XML configuration\n\nIBM has an article about why Spring Framework is so popular and how Spring Boot eases the creation of Spring projects: From ibm.com:\n\nSpring Framework offers a dependency injection feature that lets objects define their own dependencies that the Spring container later injects into them. This enables developers to create modular applications consisting of loosely coupled components that are ideal for microservices and distributed network applications.\n\n\nAs capable as comprehensive as Spring Framework is, it still requires significant time and knowledge to configure, set up, and deploy Spring applications. Spring Boot mitigates this effort with three important capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutoconfiguration means that applications are initialized with pre-set dependencies that you don’t have to configure manually.\n\nAs Java Spring Boot comes with built-in autoconfiguration capabilities, it automatically configures both the underlying Spring Framework and third-party packages based on your settings (and based on best practices, which helps avoid errors)\nEven though you can override these defaults once the initialization is complete, Java Spring Boot’s autoconfiguration feature enables you to start developing your Spring-based applications fast and reduces the possibility of human errors.\n\n\n\n\nSpring Boot uses an opinionated approach to adding and configuring starter dependencies, based on the needs of your project.\n\nFollowing its own judgement, Spring Boot chooses which packages to install and which default values to use, rather than requiring you to make all those decisions yourself and set up everything manually.\nYou can define the needs of your projects during the initialization process, during which you choose among multiple starter dependencies –called _Spring Starters– that cover typical use cases. You run Spring Boot Initializr by filling out a simple web form, without any codingYou can define the needs of\n\n\n\n\nSpring Boot helps developers create applications that just run.\n\nIt lets you create standalone applications that run on their own, without relying on an external web server, by embedding a web server such as Tomcat or Netty into your app during the initialization process\nAs a result, you can launch your application on any platform by simply hitting th Run command\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the key concepts of Spring Boot and how it works include:\n\nBeans: a Java object managed by the Spring container\n\nBeans are typically defined in configuration files, and the Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of these beans\n\nDependency Injection: Spring uses dependency injection to manage the dependencies between beans\n\nThis means that instead of instantiating and configureing dependencies manually, you can use annotations or configuration files to tell the Spring container which dependencies a bean has and how they should be instantiated\n\nObject-Oriented Programming: it uses interfaces and inheritance to create a modular and reusable codebase\nAspect-Oriented Programming: this allows to separate cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management from the core business logic of your application\nData Access: Spring Boot provides a set of starters and libraries for connecting to databases and performing data access operations.\n\nIt also provides support for Object-Relational-Mapping (ORM) frameworks such as Hibernate and JPA\n\nWeb Development: Spring Boot provides a set of starters and libraries for building web applications and RESTful web services.\n\nIt also provides support for web technoligies such as Spring MVC and Thymeleaf\n\nAnnotations: Spring Boot uses annotations extensively to configure beans and manage dependencies\n\nUnderstanding the different annotations available in Spring, such as @Bean, @Autowired, @Component, can help you effectively use the framework\n\nMVC (Model-View-Controller): Spring Boot provides support for the MVC architectural pattern, which separates the application into three layers:\n\nThe model (data)\nThe view (presentation)\nThe controller (logic)\n\nUnderstanding how MVC works in Spring boot can help you structure your appliication effectively. See model entry for more details regarding MVC.\nREST (Representational State Transfer): Spring Boot provides support for building RESTful web services.\n\nUnderstanding the principles of REST and how to create RESTful web services using Spring Boot can help you effectively use the framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sum up\n\n\n\nOverall, Spring Boot works by providing a set of pre-configured options and defaults, as well as a set of tools for quickly creating and running an application using the Spring Framework.\nIt uses concepts such as beans, dependency injection and OOP to make it easy to build and run a Spring-based application, with minimal configuration and setup required."

It is based on a client-server model, where a client sends a request to a server and the server sends a response.\nRESTful APIs use HTTP requests to POST (create), PUT (update), GET (read) and DELETE (delete) data.\nA RESTful API is a simple, consistent, and easy-to-use way for applications to communicate with each other over the internet.\n\n\n\nIt is the common language between a client and a server, so the client knows what operations are available in the server. Common REST API operations\n\nPOST (Create)\nGET (Read)\nPUT (Update)\nDELETE (Delete)\n\nSo the base operations are the classic CRUD, but can be expanded. In fact, it is a set of definitions and protocols, sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an Information user.\nThis contract (API Rest style) establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI Weather example\n\n\n\nThe API design for a weather service could ask the user for a zip code as a requestand then return a response in the form of a 2-part answer, being the first one the high temperature and the second one the low temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\nPending to elaborate!"

We can manage all the client’s accounts as a HashMap where its keys are the account’s owners (Person) and each value is a list of accounts (Account). This way we are decoupling classes Account and Person.\nThe AccountManager class is created as a Singleton to force its usage when managing

In software engineering, the domain commonly refers to the subject area on which the application is intended to apply.\nIn other words, during appliaction development, the domain is the sphere of knowledge and activity around which the application logic resolves.\nThe domain layer or domain logic is better known as the business logic. The business logic of an application refers to the higher-level rules for how buisness objects interact with one another to create and modify modeled data.\n\n\n\nDDD aims to ease the creation of complex applications by connecting the related pieces of software into an ever-evolving model.\nDDD focueses on three core principles:\n\nFocus on the core domain and domain logic\nBase complex designs on models of the domain\nCollaboration with domain experts to improve the application model and resolve any emerging domain-related issues"

    "section": "Building Blocks",
    "text": "Building Blocks\nDomain-driven design also defines several high-level concepts that can be used in conjunction with one another to create and modify domain models:\n\nEntity: An object identified by its consistent thread of continuity, as opposed to traditional objects, which are defined by their attributes\n\nCustom interpretation:\n\nValue Object: An immutable (unchangeable) object that has attributes but no distinct identity\n\nCustom interpretation:\n\nDomain event: An object that records a discrete event related to model activity within the system. While all events within the system could be tracked, a domain event is only created for event types that the domain experts care about.\n\nCustom interpretation:\n\nAggregate: A cluster of entities and value objects with defined boundaries around the group. Rather than allowing every single entity or value object to perform all actions on its own, the collective aggregate of items is assigned a singular aggregate root item. Now, external objects no longer have direct access to every individual entity or value object within the aggragate but instead only have access to the single aggregate root item and use that to pass along instructions to the group as a whole.\n\nCustom interpretation:\n\nService: Essentially, a service is an operation or form of business logic that doesn’t naturally fit within the realm of objects. In other words, if some functionality must exist, but it cannot be related to an entity or value object, it’s probably a service.\n\nCustom interpretation:\n\nRepositories: Not to be confused with common version control repositories, the DDD meaning of a repository is a service that uses a global interface to provide access to all entities and value objects within a particular aggregate collection. Methods should be defined to allow for the creation, modification, and deletion of objects within the aggregate. However, by using this repository service to make data queries, the goal is to remove such data query capabilities from within the business logic of object models.\n\nCustom interpretation:\n\nFactories: DDD suggests using a factory, which encapsulates the logic of creating complex objects and aggregates, ensuring that the client does not know the inner-workings of object manipulation.\n\nDDD heavily emphasizes the ever-more-popular practice of continuous integration (CI), which asks the entire development team to use one shared code repository and push commits to it daily (if not multiple times a day).\nAn automatic process executes at the end of the work day, which checks the integrity of the entire code base, running automated unit tests, regression tests, and the like to quickly detect any potential problems that may have been introduced in the latest commits."

    "text": "Advantages of Domain-Driven Design\n\nEases Communication: With an early emphasis on establishing a common and ubiuitous language related to the domain model of the project, teams will often find communitacion throughout the entire development life cycle to be much easier. Typically, DDD will require less technical jargon when discussing aspects of the application since the ubiquitous language established early on will likely define simpler terms to refer to those more technical aspects.\nImproves Flexibility: Since DDD is so heavily based on the concepts of object-oriented analysis and design, nearly everything within the domain model will be based on an object and will, therefore, be modular and encapsulated. This allows for various components, or even the entire system, to be altered and improved on a regular, continuous basis.\nEmphasizes Domain Over Interface: Since DDD is the practice of building around the concepts of domain and what the domain experts within the project advise, DDD will often produce applications that are accurately suited for and representative of the domain at hand, as opposed to those applications which emphasize the UI/UX first and foremost. While balance is required, focusing on the domain means that a DDD approach can produce a product that resonates well with the audience associated with that domain."

    "text": "Disadvantages of Domain-Driven Design\n\nRequires Robust Domain Expertise: Even with the most technically proficient minds working on development, it’s all for naught if there isn’t at least one domain expert on the team that knows the exact ins and outs of the subject area. In some cases, domain-driven design may require integrating one or more outside team members who can act as domain experts throughout the development life cycle.\nEncourages Iterative Practices: While many consider this an advantage, it cannot be denied that DDD practices strongly rely on constant iteration and continuous integration to build a malleable project that can adjust itself when necessary. Some organizations may have trouble with these practices, particularly if their past experience is primarily tied to less-flexible development models, such as the waterfall model.\nIll-Suited for Highly Technical Projects: DDD is not very well-suited for applications with marginal domain complexity but has a great deal of technical complexity. Since DDD so heavily emphasizes the need for (and importance of) domain experts to generate the proper ubiquitous language and then domain model on which the project is based, a project that is incredibly technically complex may be challenging for domain experts to grasp, causing problems down the line, perhaps when all members of the team did not fully understand technical requirements or limitations."

    "text": "MVC\nFrom Mozilla.org:\n\nMVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software’s business logic and display. This “separation of concerns” provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).\n\n\nModel parts\nAn MVC software-design pattern is composed by three parts:\n\nModel: manages data and business logic\nThe model defines what data the app should contain. If the state of thsi data changes, then the model will usually notify the view (so the display can change as needed) and sometimes the controller (if different logic is needed to control the updated view).\n\n\nView: handles layout and display\nThe view defines how the app’s data should be displayed.\n\n\nController: routes commands to the model and view parts\nThe controller contains logic that updates the model and/or view in response to input from the users of the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might however also want to just update the view to display the data in a different format, e.g., change the item order to alphabetical, or lowest to highest price.
